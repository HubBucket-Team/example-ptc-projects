# Example repository using projects for PTCs

- Each PTC is represented by a project that can have an optional description.
- The current state of the PTCs are visible by clicking on the Projects tab.
- Progress towards the PTC is tracked by opening issues that are assigned the project.
- PTC issues can also be included in the main development project and tracked as part of the normal development flow.
- PTC project names must begin with something like "PTC:" to distinguish them from other projects.
- Project templates are available, but custom templates are not currently possible.
